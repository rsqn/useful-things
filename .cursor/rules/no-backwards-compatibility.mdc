# Backwards Compatibility Policy

- **NEVER** add backwards compatibility in a plan unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **ALWAYS** confirm with the user before implementing any backwards compatibility measures.
- If you think backwards compatibility is needed, ask the user: "Do you need backwards compatibility for this change?"

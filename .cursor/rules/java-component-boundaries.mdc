# Component Boundary Enforcement (Java)

## Description

Each Spring @Service has specific responsibilities. Prevent cross-domain contamination.

## Rules

1.  **DataManager** (or equivalent state holder):

    - **Allowed**: Managing domain state (e.g., entities, collections).
    - **Forbidden**: Performing analysis or computation that belongs to another component.

2.  **EventPublisher** (or equivalent observer):

    - **Allowed**: Publishing events, notifying subscribers.
    - **Forbidden**: Updating domain state directly.

3.  **EntityProcessor** (or equivalent domain logic):

    - **Allowed**: Calculating derived values, applying business rules on entities.
    - **Forbidden**: Managing cross-entity state or orchestration.

4.  **Orchestrator** (or equivalent coordinator):
    - **Allowed**: Coordinating workflows, delegating to other components.
    - **Forbidden**: Performing low-level operations that belong to domain entities or specialized services.
